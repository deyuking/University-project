## This repository contains the full journey of obtaining the full Formula 1 dataset (containg races from 1953-2019).
#### The "Data Collection" notebook contains the code for the API extraction of data using ergast.com
#### The "Data Modelling" notebooks contain the code which applies the Machine Learning algorithms to the data.
#### The "EDA" notebook contains some visuals detailing some basic statistics such as which driver is more prone to crashing, where F1 races are held etc.

### IMPORTANT: You might get a message stating that the "EDA F1" notebook took too long to render. Please use this link to view the notebook: https://nbviewer.org/github/deyuking/University-project/blob/main/EDA%20F1.ipynb
